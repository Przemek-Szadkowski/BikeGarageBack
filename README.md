## General info

The Bike Garage app helps with manage bike repair service. It is a place to store all information related to orders and a tool to simplify contact with clients. This idea was born during visits to my friend's bicycle service - Retrofabryka. Mateusz runs one of the best bicycle services in central Poland (Łask city). He looks after each bike with heart and great knowledge - check google reviews! He has a lot of orders and contact with clients takes a lot of his time. So I came up with the idea to create an application that would simplify his contact with clients and help to control the constantly growing number of orders.

This is the first time that I have tried to create such an application. I started coding this application at the end of Mega Kurs, trying to use all my knowledge. After the information about the criteria for passing the course was announced, it turned out that I could submit it as a final project.

This is the first version of my app, so I have many ideas to improve it and fix bugs - look features subsection.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- MySQL
- Express.js

## Features

### TODO LIST:

This is my first attempt to create any login system, so I am aware that this part is primarily for correction. Same as RWD, which I didn't implement at all - I wanted to focus on the application.

- RWD,
- authorization and authentication,
- search bars for admin to filter current orders and archive,
- add email or sms info for client, when bike is ready to collect,
- authorization for clients (password needed to log in, not only order number),
- rerender orders list when admin is sending back message to client (turn off new message icon).

## Status

Project is: \_in progress

## Inspiration

Project inspired by my friend Mateusz - owner of bike service RetroFarbyka in Łask city.
